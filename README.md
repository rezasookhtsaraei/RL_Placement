**1. Purpose of the Code:**  

   This repository provides the full implementation of the proposed method presented in the paper: 
   
   **Title:"A placement method based on deep reinforcement learning for mission critical services in computing continuum"**
   The code is intended to reproduce all simulation results, figures, and tables reported in the manuscript and to facilitate further validation and extension of the
   proposed approach under different system settings.  
   
**2.Prerequisites:**  

  Before running the simulations, please ensure that the following requirements are met:
  Operating System: Linux / macOS / Windows (tested on: Windows)
  Required software packages and libraries:
     Python ≥ 3, 
     numpy,
     torch,
     matplotlib,
     networkx, 
     collections,
     time
     copy
     simpy  
     
**3.Running the Simulations:**  

To execute the algorithms and perform a fair comparison among them, it is only required to configure the random seed values. By adjusting the seeds, all algorithms are evaluated under identical experimental conditions, ensuring consistency and reproducibility of the simulation results across different runs.
